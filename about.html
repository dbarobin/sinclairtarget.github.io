<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is a blog about computer history intended for software developers.
There's lots of writing out there about the history of computing for a general
audience, but there is less for a technical audience. My hope is that this blog
can answer interesting historical questions that might only occur to somebody
who designs and builds software everyday, questions like
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2017-09-21-the-rise-and-rise-of-json.md %}">Where did JSON come from?</a> and
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2017-09-28-the-lineage-of-man.md %}">Why are man pages still a thing?</a></p>
