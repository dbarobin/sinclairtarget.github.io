<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is a blog about computer history intended primarily for computer
people. While there is a lot of writing out there about the history of

historical questions that might only occur to somebody who designs and builds
software every day, questions like

<a href="{{site.url}}{% link _posts/2017-09-28-the-lineage-of-man.md %}">Why are man pages still a thing?</a></p>
